    description: "The appearance day of H H Nava Yogendra Swami Mahraj, disciple of A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada founder-acharya of ISKCON is celebrated as Vyasa Puja. H H Nava Yogendra Swami Maharaj was born on 12th May, 1946 on the auspicious day of Rukmini Dwadashi.\
\
    The Vedas originate from the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. Lord Sri Krishna imparted the Vedic knowledge to Lord Brahma, the creator of this universe. Brahma instructed his son Narada, who in turn gave this knowledge to Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva compiled the Vedic knowledge and also composed the eighteen puranas. Under the instructions of his spiritual master Narada, he also authored Srimad Bhagavatam, which is called the spotless Purana. He distributed this knowledge throughout this world through his disciples.\
    \
    A bona fide spiritual master coming in this line of succession descending from Vyasadeva is considered a representative of Vyasa deva. H H Nava Yogendra Swami Mahraj is the 33rd Diksha Guru in this disciplic succession and his disciples observe his appearance day as Vyasa Puja. Devotees celebrate this auspicious day in a grand manner, and read their offerings written by them to glorify Sri Guru Mahraj ji. A grand abhisheka is performed and prasadam is distributed.\
